sample run of the overlay for 300 seconds:

'./generate_config.py 10 config_hosts > config.txt'
'./start_overlay.py 300 config.txt > output'

The file config_hosts should contain hostnames, one per line, to which the
overlay is deployed over ssh. The overlay will send messages to every node for
300 seconds. The file output will contain hop counts for messages received.
